# Web Scraping Music Record Labels

As an intern working with Octavate, I was tasked with writing web-scraping scripts in Python. I made use of scraping packages like Beautiful Soup - for simple websites and Selenium for dynamically changing websites. 

Our objective was to extract data about artists under the various record labels. This data essentially comprised: 
	1. Name
 
	2. Social Media Links
 
	3. Music Genre

The social media links we looked for could range from Spotify channels to Instagram handles.

I completed a total of around 50 scripts whilst doing that. 

I was also tasked with creating a simple front end website to display all the extracted data in a suitable and comprehensible manner. 

This project taught me a lot about Web scraping tools like Selenium, Front End technologies like HTML, CSS and JS. 

You can find some of the scripts that I wrote in this repository.
